# Requirements

Using flex and grid, the gallery was kind of responsive without media queries, but I added them just to make the thumbnail container and heading a little smaller so more proportionate on smaller screens. The fundamental layout is unchanged though.

All the images have alt text.

The user can change the image by clicking on the thumbnail. I felt it was useful to highlight which image is selected in the thumbnail list, so I added a yellow border to the active thumbnail.

# Comments

If I'd have enough time I'd have liked to explore key binding, but I've been too busy this weekend. It's something I might come back and have a look at later.

# Sources

Various sites I stole images from - they belong to their owners!
W3Schools as usual of course.
